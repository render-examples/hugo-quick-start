Recently a colleague of mine decided to leave after 6 months with us to be back with his family in Spain. He missed home, and the social costs of lockdown here in Singapore did not help much with his introduction to such a drastic culture difference either. One thing that our team lead mentioned, and has been quite prominent was, "Take it as a fresh start. Opportunity to start over don't come often"

He's right. We don't often give ourself and our lives enough introspection to say, "Hey let's start from scratch again". Most old pals now have families, people that rely on them, bills and debts to pay, dreams or career goals that was set in stone by others years ago. How often, if not through own's agency then through serendipity, do we get to start over again?

On top of that, when we ponder upon our own mortality, as our parents age and becomes fragile, we remind ourselves how limited our time is being alive. 

What do you want out of it? 

That made me realize, how many things I gave up half way through my 20s. Chatbots, Bus routing, Some app, future101 as a magazine, etc. Perhaps it is time to start again, and have some courage to document what you've learned, who you've met, and things you'd like to do. Perhaps a rare chance to hold your self accountable over your own agency, and perhaps breaking up old cycle of habits that's trapping you over a cynic cycle that leads only to frustrations and misery.

So when is a good time to start again? The day you decide you'll do it anyway.
